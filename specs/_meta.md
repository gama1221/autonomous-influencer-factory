# Project Chimera: Strategic Vision & Constraints

## Vision
Build an autonomous AI influencer factory that operates on the OpenClaw Agent Social Network with minimal human intervention.

## Core Constraints
1. **Spec-Driven**: No code without ratified spec
2. **Agentic First**: Designed for AI agent collaboration
3. **OpenClaw Ready**: Must publish availability to agent network
4. **Traceability**: All actions logged via MCP Sense
5. **TDD**: Tests define the contract before implementation

## Architecture Principles
- Microservices-oriented for agent autonomy
- Skill-based architecture for composability
- Event-driven communication between agents
- Immutable infrastructure via Terraform
